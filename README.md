A stroke, sometimes called a "brain attack," occurs when blood flow to an area in the brain is cut off. The brain cells, deprived of the oxygen and glucose needed to survive, die. If a stroke is not caught early, permanent brain damage or death can result.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based onthe input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
There can be various factors related to occurrence to stroke. So, using the data we try to list out the potential factors by using various visualization techniques.

Visualize the relationships between various Healthy and Unhealthy habits to Heart Strokes, and there by predict the stroke probability with best model and hyper tuned parameters.
